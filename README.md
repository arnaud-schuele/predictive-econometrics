# predictive-econometrics

This project was part of a class on predictive econometrics at the University of St.Gallen (2020).
The aim was to compare the performance (R-Square) of three methods to predict sales volumes of juice for a grocery shop.
To do so, I used OLS, Ridge and elastic net estimators.
